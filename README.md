# Pointers Lab

## Description

This is a pointers lab.
It demonstrates different methods for accessing and manipulating array elements using pointers and pointer arithmetic. 
The lab focuses on understanding the relationship between arrays and pointers, showcasing how pointer notation and 
arithmetic can be used to interact with array data.

## Features

- **Array Initialization:** Demonstrates declaring and initializing an array.
- **Subscript Notation:** Shows how to access array elements using subscript notation.
- **Pointer/Offset Notation:** Illustrates how to access array elements using pointer arithmetic.
- **Pointer Arithmetic:** Explains how to navigate and modify array data using pointers.
- **Element Referencing:** Compares different methods to access specific elements in an array.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio)
- Basic understanding of C++ pointers and arrays

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanchez-softwareengineer/PointersLab8.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project**

   Open the cloned repository in your preferred C++ IDE or text editor.

3. **Build the Project**

   Compile the code using your C++ compiler. For example, using g++:

   ```bash
   g++ -o pointers_lab main.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Execute the compiled application:

   ```bash
   ./pointers_lab
   ```

## Usage

1. **Subscript Notation**

   The application prints the elements of the array using subscript notation.

2. **Pointer/Offset Notation**

   The application demonstrates accessing array elements using pointer arithmetic.

3. **Pointer/Offset Notation with Array Name**

   Shows how to use the array name as a pointer to access elements.

4. **Subscript Notation on Pointer**

   Illustrates using subscript notation on a pointer to access array elements.

5. **Element Referencing**

   Compares different methods to reference and display a specific element in the array.

## File Structure

- **main.cpp:** Contains the main function and demonstrates various pointer operations with arrays.
